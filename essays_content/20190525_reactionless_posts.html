        <p>I’m trying to write more here. I don’t share links to these posts on
        any social media networks. There is no way to comment too. There is no
        way to react <i>directly</i> to any of these posts if someone wants to. This
        is on purpose. It’s not that I’m against feedback or comments. For
        example, if someone actually takes time and comments on my pull requests
        in detail, it makes me extremely happy. I think a programmer who’s not
        open to feedback is not a programmer at all. Then why am I not enabling
        it on these posts?</p>
        <p> The answer is my reason behind writing these posts (with reactions
        or no reactions) at all. I’ve always struggled with gathering my thoughts
        in short amount of time before presenting them to someone. If someone
        asks my opinion about something subjective, in most of the cases they’ll
        get an answer filled with relevant information, but it’ll be scattered
        all over. If I take few minutes before answering, then I can gather
        everything I know about the subject in my head and give a better answer
        (I guess this is most of us). But I don’t do that often and it is not
        practical too. Writing thoughts always helps with arranging them properly.
        And that is the reason I’m writing these posts.</p>
        <p>This is an exercise for me to get used to organizing thoughts before
        shooting them at someone in disorganized way. Most of these posts will
        be written in very short period of time (minutes). Not all will make
        sense (including this one). But once I write a post, I am going to read
        it several times over a long period of time. That way I can compare old
        posts with new ones and see if I’m getting better at organizing my
        thoughts and presenting them in words.</p>
