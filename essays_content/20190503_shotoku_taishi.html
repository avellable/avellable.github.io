        <p>I've been living in Japan for almost 5 years now. But, whenever my
        friends and family back home ask me about Japanese history, I still
        can't answer most of their questions. So this year I took upon myself
        to read more about Japan's past.</p>
        <p>I'm going through stuff chronologically. And very early in my
        readings, I came across Shotoku Taishi (Prince Shotoku). He was heir to the
        throne and was supposed to succeed Empress Suiko. Now the story of why
        he was nominated as heir is a very interesting one. But this post is not
        about that. What interests me more is that what the legends say about
        his abilities. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihon_Shoki">Nihon
        Shoki</a> he had abilities such as,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>he could speak as soon as he was born</li>
          <li>he could listen to 10 people at the "same time" and resolve their
          concerns</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because of these unbelievable qualities, it is hard for me to believe
        if he really ever existed. But the second quality of resolving 10
        people's concern at the same time seems really interesting to me. In the
        prince's time (5XX ADs), it was obviously impossible. How would 10 people
        speak to him at the same time? I mean 10 people speaking at the same time
        without getting bothered by other 9 people is impossible. So it had to
        be sequential. So the nearest he could have got to "same time" is
        listening to them one by one and then resolving their concerns one by
        one. But what if some of them had follow up questions, then they would
        again speak to him one by one and the process goes on as before.</p>
        <p>I was wondering if he existed today, could he achieve the second
        quality? Because I do something similar almost every day. At work we use
        Slack. Since I work as a server/backend engineer, I get asked a lot of
        questions from mobile app developers, QA and customer support all the
        time. Since I'm trying out Pomodoro technique, I try to answer their
        queries in the Pomodoro breaks. And that is more near to "same time"
        than what Prince Shotoku had possibly done. I look at one person's
        question, answer it, then move on to other person's question. Meanwhile
        the person whose question I just answered can ask me follow up question,
        and I can get back to it immediately after answering current question.</p>
        <p>So you see if Prince Shotoku has existed today, he nearly could had
        achieved the second quality mentioned above.</p>
