        <p>Next month I complete 5 years since I started working as a software engineer for money. In these 
        5 years my thought process while designing or writing software has changed dramatically. And the reason 
        for that is not that I've learned a lot of new concepts in Computer Science over the years. But, most 
        of things affected these changes have very less or nothing to do with actual Computer Science. I tried 
        to list a few of them below. Some of these might be pretty obvious to experienced engineers but they 
        might be surprising to beginners.</p>

        <h3>What costs less money?</h3>
        <p>I've worked with resource constrained environments such as PaaS a lot. Everything is managed by 
        somebody else and they ask for a lot of money if you want to scale up vertically. This makes me choose 
        my moves by what component costs less. For example, I would load records from different tables in web app 
        memory one by one instead of doing a join in the database. Because database instance does not have 
        sufficient memory and upgrading its memory costs twice the current cost.</p>

        <h3>Can we find people to maintain?</h3>
        <p>All of my last 5 years have been in Tokyo. Sometimes it can be very challenging to find suitable 
        engineers here. So, whenever I’ve tried to write something new from scratch, I had to keep in mind if the 
        tools (programming language, frameworks, etc.) being used are well known in Tokyo. If the tools are not 
        well-known then I at least make sure they are not ridiculously difficult to understand.</p>

        <h3>Co-worker's comfort</h3>
        <p>Sometimes even though I have a perfect tool for something only I am responsible for and am well versed 
        with it, my co-workers aren't. I always keep in mind the scenario where either I go on a vacation or move 
        on to another job. In those scenarios my co-workers have to maintain the system, although it’s not their 
        main responsibility. So, I always try to choose what everyone is comfortable with.</p>

        <h3>Convincing a superior</h3>
        <p>As a beginner I've caused my share of bugs. But at the same time, I've delivered way more working 
        features. But somehow, some of my superiors always remembered that one time I caused a bug and they had 
        to answer clients or their superiors. So, when I am explaining a better solution for a certain problem, 
        they're less open minded. And this affects my choice of right design a lot. I try to balance between the 
        amount of effort put in convincing my boss and actual implementation effort.</p>

        <p>Sometimes I absolutely hate that I’ve to take above factors into consideration (especially the last one) 
        while creating something new. But it can’t be helped and I do what I have to do.</p>
