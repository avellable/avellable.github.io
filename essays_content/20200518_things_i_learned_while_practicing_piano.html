        <p>I started learning piano almost three years ago at age of 26. According to norm that is very late.
        I got interested in piano and music more while reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach">Gödel, Escher, Bach</a>. 
        Next thing I know I walked into a tutor's office and asked him to teach me. I rented a piano from him and 
        started practicing a lot. Following are few things I learned due to practicing piano which also affect 
        other aspects of my life.</p>

        <h3>Rushing through is not same as going fast</h3>
        <p>In the beginning, my tutor called me せっかち a lot. It just means impatient in Japanese. I am pretty 
        good at memorizing a piece of tune. Whenever the tune demanded higher 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo">tempo</a>, I would panic and just press the keys faster. 
        But that made the tune sound horrible. My tutor would almost yell at me every time. The interval between 
        notes mattered a lot too. I realized I do same kind of thing sometimes while doing other things too. This 
        was not a big revelation but still felt good to be reminded.</p>

        <h3>Spoken language is <i>just</i> another medium of communication</h3>
        <p>When I started going to the tutor, my Japanese skills were very limited. At the same time my tutor does
        not speak any English. So all our communication is in Japanese, except some musical terms. But he was still
        able to teach me well enough. Whatever he would say, he would demonstrate too. So the language did not matter
        much the first time he introduced me to a concept. I would co-relate the words to what he demonstrated and
        use them next time when we came across same concept. But the words did not really matter to me the first time.
        I started using the same technique at work too, I would use white board a lot while talking to non native
        English speakers. I wasn't afraid at all discussing with them anymore.</p>

        <h3>Some things can never be learned completely</h3>
        <p>My tutor has been practicing piano for 40 something years. He still says its a long way to go for him to 
        learn every aspect of piano music. As a programmer I can always learn a technology in its entirety. Even though
        that technology is evolving, if I focus only on that technology, I can always keep up. But piano music seems
        different. I have heard same things about other skills too but experienced it for the first time.</p>

        <p>These are just few of many things I have realized and can articulate in words. But I'm pretty sure there are
        more things I learned just because of practicing piano everyday.</p>
