        <p>Sometimes whenever I have nothing to do or am waiting for a build to be 
        completed, I go through my followers and people I follow on Github/Twitter. I
        click on each individual person and see their profile. See what they are up to
        these days. Usually there's a link in their profile to personal website. Almost
        every website has a blog attached to it. Most of these blogs don't have new 
        posts in years and that makes me really sad.</p>
        <p>I try to figure out for each person why there is no new post for so long.
        Usually the reasons are very obvious,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>they are very busy with work</li>
          <li>they have moved onto doing something else than tech</li>
          <li>they just started using other platform such as Twitter to express themselves</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But sometimes the reason is not that obvious and my mind starts speculating 
        wildly. Recently I came up with few more reasons,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>maybe they do not have anything to share anymore</li>
          <li>maybe they stopped discovering new things</li>
          <li>maybe they think their opinions/thoughts are not worth writing down</li>
        </ul> 
        <p>The last one bothers me a lot. Because most of these people are older than me.
        Most in their thirties. If its true why would they think their thoughts don't 
        matter now? Did they realize that things they want to say are not new? Maybe 
        they sat down to write a new blog post but realized that someone already said 
        the same thing already. If this is true then as I learn more things and know 
        more people, chances are I am going to do the same. That makes me more sad.</p>
        <p>Above is just one train of thought I keep riding until my build is finished or
        have to get back to work. But this happens every time. Even if it makes me sad I 
        think its very interesting to come up with a theory why a certain blog died. If I
        just ask them directly, reason is going to be something dumb, like "Oh that thing, 
        I forgot I had that."</p>

        <p>Looking for comments? This is a no comment zone! Try to read this post as is. Do
        not come up with opinions on it. Sometimes it is good to just listen to someone
        carefully and not say anything back. Trust me, just try it.</p>
